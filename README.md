# Image-Classification-Using-Tensorflow

This experience about basic task in computer vision that is image recognition. 
The numpy array and Tensorflow frameworks are required. 
The numpy array as the image objects. The Tensorflow frameworks is mainly used to create deep learning algorithm and build convolutional neural network (CNN)
This blog describe how to build an image classification model based on Tensorflow 2.0 and python. It provides trainees with basic concept of deep learning model building.

This experiment recognizes image categories based on the Cifar10 dataset

**Dataset**

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class.
